This project is an inventory management system that takes a txt file, reads the inventory contents, and displays an interface for 
a user to make purchases or returns. Once the user is satisfied with their transactions, they may exit the program thereby creating a receipt.

The inventory management system is the application of all the basic programming and Python topics needed for a solid foundation - Loops,
Control Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Encapsulation.
